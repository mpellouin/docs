# Authentication

Authentication is an important topics in securing an API. Indeed most of the time, not all function should be publicly available and therefore some kind of auth is required. As for us, we are using basic jwt token authentication, meaning on protected routes, you've got to add the following header:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'
```

with token in place of \<token\>.

The token is then retrieved by our API to check if it matches with some user's token in our DB. If no token is provided or if it is invalid, the API will just respond with a 401 Unauthorized code.

# OAuth

As per OAuth, the system is pretty simple. If a user needs to connect through one of our OAuth providers, then he just has to call the endpoint as such: GET /auth/\<provider\>

This will open up a pop-up asking user for contents and the page will get redirected back to the app with credentials as parameters.

It is fairly easy on the front-end side but might be more complicated on the back-end side. Do not hesitate to contact back end developers.
