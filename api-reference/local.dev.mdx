# Setup

You'll need to install docker, then clone the api repository.

next step is to setup the .env file like following :

```bash
# All the undefined values can be find in the ressources channel of the backend, watch out as they can be prod values

BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080" #url of the api, important for OAuth and company
PORT="8080"
DEV_URI="*"
MAPBOX_TOKEN=""
JWT_SECRET=""
CLIENT_URI="http://localhost:3000"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=""
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=""
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=""
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=""
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=""
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=""
TRACKING_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=""
DB_URI=""
AI_SERVER_URI=""
AI_SERVER_SECRET=""
FLICKR_API_KEY=""
FLICKR_SECRET=""
FOURSQUARE_SECRET=""
DB_SSL="false" # Should be false when working locally
IS_PROD="false" # Should be false when working locally
LOG_SQL="false" # Depends if you want to see the SQL transactions to the database
COST_OF_LIVING_API=""
COST_OF_LIVING_API_KEY=""
```

# Run the back

to run the back-end you just need to run the following command :

`docker compose up`

Both the local Postgres and Api shoud now run automatically, and all the changes to the api should automatically reload as you do some changes.
