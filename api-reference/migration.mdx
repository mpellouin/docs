# What are migrations

Migrations lets you update the tables and the database structure while being easy to rollback in case anything goes wrong.
That's why it is important to keep all the migration data for every update.

# Apply the migrations

Whenever you build an instance of the app, you must check that you have the last migration available, then start the
project in order to run the migration

to do so :  `npm run migration:run`

here is an example of what is should print :

```SQL
query: SELECT * FROM current_schema()
query: CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"
query: SELECT version();
query: SELECT * FROM "information_schema"."tables" WHERE "table_schema" = 'public' AND "table_name" = 'migration_table'
query: SELECT * FROM "migration_table" "migration_table" ORDER BY "id" DESC
0 migrations are already loaded in the database.
1 migrations were found in the source code.
1 migrations are new migrations must be executed.
query: START TRANSACTION
query: ALTER TABLE "ticket" ADD "test" character varying NOT NULL DEFAULT 'null'
query: ALTER TABLE "trips" ALTER COLUMN "startDate" SET DEFAULT '1711139306177'
query: ALTER TABLE "trips" ALTER COLUMN "endDate" SET DEFAULT '1711139306177'
query: INSERT INTO "migration_table"("timestamp", "name") VALUES ($1, $2) -- PARAMETERS: [1711139303995,"Test1711139303995"]
Migration Test1711139303995 has been  executed successfully.
query: COMMIT
```

Migrations have been applied successfully

# Create a migration

If you did some modifications to the tables and need to apply them, first you need to create the migration.

to do so : `npm run migration:generate --name={name_of_migration}`

it should generate a document in `src/migrations`

then you can `apply` the migration and it should all be good to go !

# Revert a migration

If the migration you applied creates problems and troubleshooting does nothing, you can revert it. by default it will
reverse the last executed migration.

to do so : `npm run migrate:revert`
